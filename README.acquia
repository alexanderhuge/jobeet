Welcome to your Acquia Cloud repository.

Commit your website's code to Acquia Cloud using Git or SVN. Acquia Cloud
expects your code (such as index.php, /includes, /modules, and /sites) to be in
the /docroot directory. Do NOT put your code in the directory that contains this
README file as it will not work.

After you commit your code, sign in to Acquia Cloud, find your site in the
list, and select the 'Cloud' link to access your workflow page. Use this page
to deploy that code to your Development, Staging, or Production environments.
